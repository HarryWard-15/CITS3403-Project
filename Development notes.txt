!!! FULL REFACTORING OF PROJECT FOLDER
- Purpose: allow project to be distributed via git
- also ensures that between clones/commits/whatever the project is distributed correctly
- side note: I found it difficult to get the project running from the first clone - this aims to resolve that.

- Updated readme file to include installation instructions

- Switched gitignore to a python template gitignore from HTML gitignore

- Refactoring HTML pages so that they are a little more modular & fitting with Flask syntax and whatnot

- Following lots of Flask megatutorial methods of implementing functionality!

----------------------------------------------------------------

- Separated login and signup pages for sake of better presentation


----------------------------------------------------
Have started the database connection, was super dicky but got it to work, I'm going to write all the seeds and schema stuff.

only minor changed to the front end with fixing the nav bar and a view visual errors in the signup/login boxes.

I think our next plan should be to sit together and discuss out schema so i can write it fully and discuss how its going to interact.
