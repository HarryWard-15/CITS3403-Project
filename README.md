## CitizenCypher

# Installation 
```
python -m venv venv
```
```
cd CITS3403-Project
```
```
source venv/Scripts/activate    (you will have the change the file extension to either bat or ps1)
```
```
python venv/Scripts/setup.py install    (not 100% if this works, run activate first and then try flask run, if not then try this with and without the install at the end. I think we will have to look into this, if nothing works then just manually run 'pip install' on all the packages in the setup.py  )
```
```
flask run 
```
